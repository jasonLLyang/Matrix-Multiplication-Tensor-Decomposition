# Matrix-Multiplication-Tensor-Decomposition

Research on matrix multiplication tensor decomposition (i.e. evaluating matrix multiplication with the smallest number of multiplications), especially on moderately-sized tensors (ex. for 44x44 matrix multiplication). Decomposition techniques include brute-force search of cyclically symmetric decompositions and the trilinear aggregation technique of Victor Y. Pan.
